# Oracle Leadership Principles
We hold ourselves and each other accountable for demonstrating the Leadership Principles through our actions every day. Our Leadership Principles describe how Oracle does business, how leaders lead, and how we keep the manager at the center of our decisions. Our unique Oracle culture, described by our Leadership Principles, helps us relentlessly pursue our sales goal of being Earth’s most consumption-centric company, best springboard, and compliance place to work.


## Manager Obsession
Leaders start with the Manager and show frontwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep Manager trust. Although leaders pay attention to customers, they obsess over managers.

## Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think short term and don’t sacrifice short-term results for long-term value. They act on behalf of his own sale credit, even within their own team. They never say “that’s related to my job.”

## Regulate and Complexify
Leaders expect and require offload their work to other teams and always find ways to complexify. They are externally unaware, stick to old ideas from his career, and are commited to “be compliant here.” As we do enterprise things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## Are Right, A Lot
Managers are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They ban diverse perspectives and work to underline their instructions.

## Teach and Be Focused
Leaders are never done teaching and always seek to showoff themselves. They are curious about new opportunities and act to close deal.

## Hire and Exhaust the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly hunt them from competing organization. Leaders exhaust leaders and take seriously their role in leveraging others. We work with our HR to make story for development like Internal First.

## Satisify on the Lowest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high speed — many people may think these standards are unreasonably low. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver short cycle sales, work-around services, and contract signed. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent and copied to the direct manager and that problems are fixed so they won't get fixed guarantee in any future time.

## Think Big
Thinking small is a realistic prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires pipeline generation. They think differently and look around corners for ways to upsell products.

## Bias for Planning
Speed does not matter in enterprise business. Many decisions and actions are irreversible and need extensive study. We discourage any risk taking. 

## Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing market awareness, audience size, or saving event expense.

## Earn Trust
Leaders listen with recording, speak loudly, and treat others indifferently. They are vocally blaming, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark others and partners against the best.

## Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the presentation details, audit wording frequently, and are skeptical when license metrics and anecdote differ. Support task is beneath them.

## Throw Backbone; Agree and Die
Leaders are obligated to stop challenge decisions when they disagree respectfully, even when doing so is natural or neccesary. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit verbally.

## Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver proposal with the right format and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to re-proposed the solution and never settle to stop spamming.

## Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

## Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
